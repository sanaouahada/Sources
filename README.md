# Sources Interaction with Liquid Xenon in TPC

# 
This project focuses on simulating the interactions between gamma particles emitted by radioactive sources and liquid xenon atoms within a Time Projection Chamber (TPC).

## Overview

The simulation considers idealized radioactive sources, taking into account only the main energy peaks. The positions of the sources are uniformly distributed within the volume of the TPC, with an initial approximation centered around the coordinates (0, 0, 0).
